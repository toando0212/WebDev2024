        <p>On the evening of October 6 (Vietnam time), Man Utd faced Aston Villa in an away match as part of the 7th round of the Premier League.

            At the start of the match, both teams created an end-to-end contest with dangerous shots.
            
            In the 5th minute, Marcus Rashford made a familiar run down the left flank before unleashing a powerful shot, but he couldn’t beat the outstanding goalkeeper Martinez.
            
            Just three minutes later, the home team responded with a sharp combination in the opponent's penalty area, but Morgan Rogers unfortunately missed with a shot that went just wide of the goal.
            
            The match then saw several tense fouls from both sides, prompting referee Robert Jones to continually issue yellow cards to ease the tension.
            
            In the closing minutes of the first half, both teams had dangerous opportunities, notably a shot from Leon Bailey from the edge of the box, but the ball was blocked by the visiting team's defense, wrapping up the first 45 minutes with no goals.
            
            As the second half began, Rashford immediately warned the home defense with a powerful shot that went over the crossbar.
            
            After that, Unai Emery's squad continuously threatened Onana's goal, but the visiting defense remained focused and resolved every dangerous situation.
            
            Meanwhile, Man Utd, while not dominating, had the best chance with a free kick that hit the crossbar, much to the disappointment of teammates and fans.
            
            Both teams were unable to find the back of the net, and the match ended in a 0-0 draw.
            
            The single point leaves Man Utd sinking further on the table in 14th place with 8 points, while Aston Villa sits in 5th place with 14 points.</p>
