            Jonathan Owens' career earnings

            Owens was born on July 22, 1995, in St. Louis, Missouri.
            
            He went to Loyola Academy of St. Louis, then he played football under coach Scott Pingel at Christian Brothers College High School (CBC).
            
            During his time in high school Owens was named CBC Linebacker of the Year.
            
            
            Owens' financial journey has been closely tied to his professional football contracts.
            
            After going undrafted in 2018, he signed with the Arizona Cardinals but faced setbacks due to injuries.
            
            However, he found stability with the Houston Texans, where he demonstrated his skills and secured a place on the active roster during four seasons.
            
            His perseverance paid off, culminating in a two-year contract with the Chicago Bears earlier this year.
            
            This contract is a significant step in his career, following a one-year deal worth $1.01 million with the Green Bay Packers in May 2023.

            Jonathan Owens' popularity skyrocketed after marriage to Simone Biles

            His earnings are not solely reliant on his NFL contracts.

            Owens also benefits from various endorsements, which enhance his overall wealth.

            His growing popularity within the sports community, highlighted by being named one of People magazine's "Sexiest Men in Sports," has undoubtedly contributed to his appeal for brand partnerships.

            Beyond the gridiron, Owens is recognized for his personal life, notably his marriage to Olympic champion Simone Biles in April 2023.

            Their relationship has attracted significant media attention, further elevating his profile.

            In addition to his football career and endorsements, Owens is investing in his future through real estate.

            He and Biles are currently building a new waterfront home in Texas showcasing their commitment to creating a life together.
